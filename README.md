# Title: Examining the Effects of Private and Public Health Expenditure on Chronic Health Outcomes in the Developed World

# Description:
This research compares private and government health expenditure in 23 developed countries around the world, examining the relationship between each type of health expenditure on chronic health conditions for the period from 2003 to 2016. While previous literature has examined the association between private and government health expenditure and chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) at a region level, this research studies this association at a global level, as well as investigating the relationship between health expenditure and two other chronic health indicators: overweight and hypertension. The findings showed a positive association between both private and government health expenditure and the rate of overweight adults, but no meaningful association was found between either type of health expenditure and the rate of hypertension. However, these results must be cautiously interpreted due to limitations with endogeneity and potential reverse causality. Regarding NCDs, this research found government health expenditure to be meaningfully associated with reduced NCD mortality rate, while no such association was found for private health expenditure. This is this studyâ€™s primary contribution to the discussion: a $1000 increase in government health expenditure per capita is estimated to decrease the rate of NCD mortality by 0.571 percent (p-value = 0.0118), while holding constant all other predictors in the model and controlling for temporal and spatial effects.
